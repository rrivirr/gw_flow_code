## Calibration Protocol
* Determine the cross sectional area of the sediment. Determine the amount of discharge required for flow at standard velocities (e.g., 0.5 ft/day, 1.0 ft/day, 15 ft/day, 30 ft/day).
* Once you have determined the discharge, adjust flow so that outflow is equal for each of the three outflow points so that the total discharge equals the desired velocity.
