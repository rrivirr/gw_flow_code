## Calibration Protocol
* Determine the cross sectional area of the sediment. Determine the amount of discharge required for flow at standard velocities (e.g., 0.5 ft/day, 1.0 ft/day, 15 ft/day, 30 ft/day).
* Once you have determined the discharge, adjust flow so that outflow is equal for each of the three outflow points so that the total discharge equals the desired velocity. Do this as follows:
  * Fill up the system with water and start running the pumps. Wait for the system to come to equilibrium.
  * Start with the bottom outflow tube. Place a graduated cylinder to collect water from the outflow tube. Using a stopwatch, measure the flow rate of the outflow tube. Use the stopcock to adjust the water flow for that tube. Check the water flow rate again with the graduated cylinder and stopwatch. Continue until you are within 5% of the desired flow rate.
  * Repeat this protocol for the middle and then the top outflow tube.
